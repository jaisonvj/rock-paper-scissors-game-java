Make a rock, paper, scissors game.

Start the game by asking the player:

"What do you choose? Type 0 for Rock, 1 for Paper or 2 for Scissors."

From there you will need to figure out:

1.How you will store the user's input.
2.How you will generate a random choice for the computer.
3.How you will compare the user's and the computer's choice to determine the winner (or a draw).
4.And also how you will give feedback to the player.
